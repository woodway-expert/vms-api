Analyze this codebase to generate or update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for guiding AI coding agents.

Focus on discovering the essential knowledge that would help an AI agents be immediately productive in this codebase. Consider aspects like:
- The "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand - major components, service boundaries, data flows, and the "why" behind structural decisions
- Critical developer workflows (builds, tests, debugging) especially commands that aren't obvious from file inspection alone
- Project-specific conventions and patterns that differ from common practices
- Integration points, external dependencies, and cross-component communication patterns

Source existing AI conventions from `**/{.github/copilot-instructions.md,AGENT.md,AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md,.cursorrules,.windsurfrules,.clinerules,.cursor/rules/**,.windsurf/rules/**,.clinerules/**,README.md}` (do one glob search).

Guidelines (read more at https://aka.ms/vscode-instructions-docs):
- If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists, merge intelligently - preserve valuable content while updating outdated sections
- Write concise, actionable instructions (~20-50 lines) using markdown structure
- Include specific examples from the codebase when describing patterns
- Avoid generic advice ("write tests", "handle errors") - focus on THIS project's specific approaches
- Document only discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices
- Reference key files/directories that exemplify important patterns

Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for the user, then ask for feedback on any unclear or incomplete sections to iterate.

I'll analyze this codebase to understand its architecture and generate appropriate Copilot instructions. Let me start by exploring the existing AI convention files and understanding the project structure. Let me read the README file and explore the main application files to understand the architecture: Now let me explore the project configuration, database setup, and models to understand the architecture better: Let me examine the models and schemas to understand the data structure: Let me also check the setup files and Docker configuration to understand the development workflow: Let me also check the Alembic configuration to understand the migration setup: Now let me check if there are any tests to understand the testing patterns: Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the codebase. Let me create the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file with specific guidance for AI agents working on this VMS API project: Let me fix the markdown formatting issues: 
```

```
Let me fix the remaining formatting issues by updating the sections with proper spacing: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive `copilot-instructions.md` file for your VMS API project. The instructions are now properly formatted and provide AI coding agents with essential knowledge about:

## Key Highlights of the Instructions:

**Architecture Understanding:**
- FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQL Server stack
- Clear separation between models, schemas, and routers
- Specific SQL Server field naming conventions (PascalCase)

**Critical Workflows:**
- PowerShell setup script for Windows development
- Alembic migration patterns
- Docker Compose setup with SQL Server
- Testing with SQLite overrides

**Project-Specific Patterns:**
- Graceful database connection handling
- Pagination and filtering conventions
- Environment-driven configuration
- Integration with external systems (Binotel)

**Development Essentials:**
- Specific commands that aren't obvious from file inspection
- Database connection formats and troubleshooting
- Testing patterns and dependency injection

The instructions focus on the "big picture" architecture and project-specific conventions that would be difficult for an AI agent to discover by just reading individual files. They emphasize practical knowledge like the specific SQL Server driver usage, the PowerShell development environment, and the unique field naming patterns.

**Would you like me to:**
1. Add any specific sections about particular workflows or patterns you use?
2. Include more details about any specific integration points?
3. Expand on any particular architectural decisions or conventions?
4. Add information about deployment or production considerations?

Add the ability for Copilot to write summaries of the work done in Ukrainian (basically make it bilingual).

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add bilingual support (English/Ukrainian) to the Copilot instructions to help with writing summaries and documentation in Ukrainian. Let me update the instructions to include this capability. 
```

```
Let me fix the markdown formatting issues by adding proper spacing around the lists: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added bilingual support (English/Ukrainian) to your Copilot instructions. The new section includes:

## Key Features Added:

**Language Support Guidelines:**
- Clear instructions for when to use English vs Ukrainian
- Bilingual formatting pattern: "English description / Українське описання"
- Specific examples for different types of content (commits, summaries, API descriptions)

**Practical Examples:**
- Commit message format with both languages
- Work summary examples
- API documentation examples

**Technical Term Translation Map:**
- Common VMS API terms with Ukrainian equivalents
- Covers key concepts like API → АПІ, Database → База даних, etc.

This will help Copilot:
1. **Write bilingual commit messages** that are clear to both English and Ukrainian speakers
2. **Generate work summaries** that can be shared with Ukrainian-speaking stakeholders
3. **Create user-facing documentation** that serves both language communities
4. **Use consistent terminology** when translating technical concepts

The instructions maintain the focus on practical, actionable guidance while adding the bilingual capability you requested. Copilot will now know to provide Ukrainian translations for summaries and user-facing content while keeping technical documentation primarily in English.

Let's add the requirement for Copilot to write comprehensive tests when adding features and keep the folder structure neat

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add guidance for comprehensive testing and maintaining clean folder structure to the Copilot instructions. Let me update the file to include these important development practices. 
```

```
