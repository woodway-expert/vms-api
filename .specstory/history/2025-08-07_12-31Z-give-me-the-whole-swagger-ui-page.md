Give me the whole swagger UI page

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you get the Swagger UI page for your VMS API. First, let me check if the application is currently running, and if not, I'll start it so we can access the Swagger UI. The API isn't currently running. Let me start it up so we can access the Swagger UI: Let me check the terminal output to see if the application has started successfully: I see the application is running on port 5000 instead of 7000. Let me check the launch settings to see the correct URLs: Now let me open the Swagger UI page in the Simple Browser. The application is running on http://localhost:5000, so the Swagger UI should be available at http://localhost:5000/swagger: Perfect! I've opened the Swagger UI page for your VMS API in the VS Code Simple Browser. The application is now running on `http://localhost:5000` and you can access the Swagger documentation at `http://localhost:5000/swagger`.

The Swagger UI page will show you:

1. **API Documentation**: All available endpoints for your VMS API
2. **Interactive Testing**: You can test endpoints directly from the Swagger interface
3. **Request/Response Models**: Detailed schemas for all DTOs and models
4. **Authentication Information**: If applicable
5. **Available Controllers**: 
   - Articles Controller
   - Customers Controller  
   - Orders Controller

You can now interact with all the API endpoints, view the request/response schemas, and test the functionality directly from the Swagger interface. The application will continue running in the background terminal until you stop it with Ctrl+C.

Can you fetch it into one file?

_**Assistant**_

I'll fetch the Swagger UI content and save it as a file for you. Let me use the fetch_webpage tool to get the Swagger UI page content: Let me try fetching the OpenAPI JSON specification directly, which is what powers the Swagger UI: Perfect! I was able to fetch the complete OpenAPI specification. Now let me create a comprehensive file with all the Swagger UI information:
