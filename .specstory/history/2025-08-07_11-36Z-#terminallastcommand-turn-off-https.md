#terminalLastCommand turn off HTTPS

---

_**Assistant**_

To turn off HTTPS in your ASP.NET Core 8 project, you need to update the launch settings and optionally the code configuration. The main step is to set "ASPNETCORE_URLS" to use only HTTP and remove HTTPS profiles from `launchSettings.json`.

Would you like me to update your `launchSettings.json` to disable HTTPS for all profiles?

---

_**User**_

Yes

---

_**Assistant**_


```

```
HTTPS has been turned off. The HTTPS profile and SSL port are removed from `launchSettings.json`, and all profiles now use only HTTP.

You can now run your API using HTTP at http://localhost:5000. If you need further changes or want to disable HTTPS redirection in code, let me know!

add login:password config for the DB

_**Assistant**_


```

```
The database connection string in `appsettings.Development.json` now includes placeholders for SQL authentication: User Id=login; Password=password. Update these values with your actual credentials as needed. Let me know if you want this change in other config files as well.

#terminalLastCommand What's that exception and how do I fix it?

---

_**Assistant**_

I don't have the exception details yet. Please provide the exception message or stack trace you are seeing, or let me know if you want to retrieve the last terminal command/output to help diagnose the issue.

The exception is a System.Text.Json.JsonException: "A possible object cycle was detected." This happens because your API is trying to serialize entities with circular references (e.g., Article → LinkAccountings → Article ...).

**How to fix:**
1. In `Program.cs`, configure JSON serialization to handle cycles by adding:
```csharp
builder.Services.AddControllers()
    .AddJsonOptions(options =>
    {
        options.JsonSerializerOptions.ReferenceHandler = System.Text.Json.Serialization.ReferenceHandler.Preserve;
    });
```
2. Alternatively, use DTOs that do not include navigation properties causing cycles.

Would you like me to update `Program.cs` to add the ReferenceHandler setting?

Fix it

_**Assistant**_


```

```
The JSON serialization settings in `Program.cs` are now configured to handle object cycles using `ReferenceHandler.Preserve`. This should resolve the circular reference exception. Please restart your application and test your endpoints again. Let me know if you encounter any further issues!

#terminalSelection is there a way to remove the HttpsRedirectionMiddleware error by turning off the trying?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you can remove the HttpsRedirectionMiddleware error by removing or commenting out the line app.UseHttpsRedirection(); in your Program.cs. This will stop the app from trying to redirect HTTP to HTTPS.

Would you like me to remove this line for you?
