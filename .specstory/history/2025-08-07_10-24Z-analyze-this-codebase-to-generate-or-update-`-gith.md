Analyze this codebase to generate or update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for guiding AI coding agents.

Focus on discovering the essential knowledge that would help an AI agents be immediately productive in this codebase. Consider aspects like:
- The "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand - major components, service boundaries, data flows, and the "why" behind structural decisions
- Critical developer workflows (builds, tests, debugging) especially commands that aren't obvious from file inspection alone
- Project-specific conventions and patterns that differ from common practices
- Integration points, external dependencies, and cross-component communication patterns

Source existing AI conventions from `**/{.github/copilot-instructions.md,AGENT.md,AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md,.cursorrules,.windsurfrules,.clinerules,.cursor/rules/**,.windsurf/rules/**,.clinerules/**,README.md}` (do one glob search).

Guidelines (read more at https://aka.ms/vscode-instructions-docs):
- If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists, merge intelligently - preserve valuable content while updating outdated sections
- Write concise, actionable instructions (~20-50 lines) using markdown structure
- Include specific examples from the codebase when describing patterns
- Avoid generic advice ("write tests", "handle errors") - focus on THIS project's specific approaches
- Document only discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices
- Reference key files/directories that exemplify important patterns

Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for the user, then ask for feedback on any unclear or incomplete sections to iterate.

I'll analyze this codebase to generate comprehensive Copilot instructions. Let me start by searching for existing AI conventions and understanding the project structure. Now let me examine the core project files to understand the architecture and patterns:
